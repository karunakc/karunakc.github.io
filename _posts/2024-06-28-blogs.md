Recently I have been reading several cool blogs and several cool people. As one does, I had the idea of curating a these blogs into another blog so that I can come back to them anytime to read them once again and feel like I had the biggest epiphany of all the epiphaies as I read them. I'll try to categorize them so that you can just jump into sections that you think will be useful for you.
